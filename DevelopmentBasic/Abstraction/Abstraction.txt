Abstraction is a principle of object oriented programming language (OOP) and it is used to hide the implementation details and display only essential features of the object.

In Abstraction, by using access modifiers we can hide the required details of object and expose only necessary methods and properties through the reference of object.

When you build your software from classes you encapsulate real world objects to software abstractions. The process of abstraction is the process to build a software model that 
presents solution for some task's in real world. Your abstractions are mapped to real object or processes and they present these objects in your software solution. Grady Booch 
defined abstraction as: 
	"An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects and thus provide crisply defined conceptual boundaries, 
	relative to the perspective of the viewer."  
Abstraction is actually part of Object Oriented Design (OOD) - the process when you build your model using object oriented technologies.

Abstraction	
It is used to hide unwanted data and show only required properties and methods.	

Encapsulation
It is used to bind data members and member functions into single unit to prevent outsiders to access it directly.
